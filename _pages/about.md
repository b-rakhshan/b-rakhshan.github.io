I am a first year PhD student in the theory group at the [Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO) Université de Montréal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/) and [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Guillaume Rabusseau](https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~grabus/). My research interests lie in the theoretical foundations of machine learning, particulary Randomized algorithms and Tensor Decompositions.
During Summer and Fall 2019, I interned at MILA. 

Prior to joining MILA, I was a PhD student at [Mathematics Department, Purdue University](https://www.math.purdue.edu/) where I was advised by [Petros Drineas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pdrineas/), you can read my story [here](https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_c29e92e2-cf28-583e-9b4f-8cc818a4d4fc.html?fbclid=IwAR2lSQvOWthN78ovRYYU2TWJgqFJDEENYLxl94ZPaD33-NsWXe_9mfgu_N8). 

Research
======
I am broadly interested in the theory behind Big Data and Machine Learning problems. My research is focused on developing fast and efficient randomized algorithms with tensor networks for large-scale problems. My goal is developing algorithms with provable guarantees, accurate and fast solutions to computationally expensive methods by leveraging dimensionality reduction and tensor decompositions' techniques
